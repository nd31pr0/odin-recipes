    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>So what is Ekwang? It is grated cocoyams tied in cocoyam leaves and 
        cooked with palm oil and other aromatic ingredients. This is one of 
        the dishes that reminds me of the similarities between Nigerians and 
        Cameroonians.</p>
    <p>The Efiks and Ibibios in Nigeria prepare something very similar which they 
        call “Ekpang Nkukwo.” In Cameroon, it is called, “Ekwang”. Some people call 
        it, “Ekpang” while others call it, “Ekwang Coco”. It is a staple of the
         Bafaw people of the South West region of Cameroon but widely eaten in 
         the rest of the country. Because it is so good!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cocoyam</li>
        <li>Leaves</li>
        <li>Palm oil</li>
        <li>Crayfish</li>
        <li>Smoked fish</li>
        <li>spices depending on preferences.</li>
        <li>Freshly blended garlic </li>
        <li>Ginger paste</li>
        <li> Some chopped onions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For a successful Ekwang dish, please get the right cocoyams.</li>
        <li>Then you peel the life out of them.</li>
        <li>If you can not find cocoyam leaves for wrapping, feel free to use
             any green leaves.</li>
        <li>Grate your cocoyams into a paste. You could use a food processor 
            but I love going the old-fashioned way with a grater. The texture it 
            gives is unbeatable.</li>
        <li>Then you wrap the cocoyam paste in leaves. Please watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CrGYcRaSTg">the video</a> 
            to see how I wrap them.
        </li>
        <li>When all the wrapping is done you dump in the other 
            ingredients and make a heartwarming pot of Ekwang. Be still, my heart.</li>
        <li>Make some soon! Check out the printable recipe below for all details.
