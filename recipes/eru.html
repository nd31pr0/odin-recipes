    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Eru is one meal that everyone in my house loves. From Mr N. to baby girl, 
        no leftovers are guaranteed. Some weeks ago, my parents sent me some dried
         Eru and crayfish all the the way from home. I leaped for joy knowing it will
          be a while before I visit an African store to purchase these leaves. My 
          parents eh. They wrote my names on the packs as though they were sending 
          me off to Form 1 in boarding school. See the packs below.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cups of Eru/Ukazi</li>
        <li>3 bags/bundles of spinach/waterleaf</li>
        <li>2-3 pounds of meat/fish of choice(beef skin/canda, beef stripes, beef, goat meat, 
            dried/smoked fish, stocked fish, snails, and/or others)</li>
        <li>2 cups of crayfish</li>
        <li>3 cups of palm oil plus half cup of canola (or groundnut) oil</li>
        <li>1 crayfish seasoning cube (Maggi Crevette)</li>
        <li>1 Habanero pepper (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If you are using dried Eru, start by soaking it in water.</li>
        <li>Wash your meat and put in the pot to boil. I used beef skin and beef 
            stripes AKA canda and towel.</li>
        <li>While the meat boils, chop your spinach or waterleaf and set aside.</li>
        <li>When your meat is half-boiled, season with salt. When it is cooked,
             add in spinach and start stirring. Spinach is quite soft and will 
             shrink fast as seen below.</li>
        <li>Then you drain Eru and add to pot. The small liquid from the Spinach 
            will make the Eru soft.</li>
        <li>Add in your fish and mix. I had some already boiled stock fish so I threw it in.</li>
        <li>Then add the oil, seasoning cube and lastly crayfish. Tip : Mixing palm oil and 
            canola/vegetable oil keeps the oil from becoming hard when the Eru is cold.</li>
        <li>Stir well and voila, Eru is ready. Serve with Water Fufu (Akpu), Garri or even 
            Pounded Yam.</li>
    </ol>
