    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fufu is easy to make, yet so delicious. It is not eaten alone, and 
        it is served with a form of rich and flavorful soup or stew such as
         egusi soup, okra soup, ewedu soup (Jute leaves), or light soup.</p>
    <p>Foofoo is made from cassava, which is also known as yuca. It is a 
        starchy root vegetable, similar to sweet potatoes, russet potatoes, 
        and yams. It can be fried, baked, and prepared just like potatoes; 
        however, it becomes very smooth, doughy, and elastic when made into fufu.
